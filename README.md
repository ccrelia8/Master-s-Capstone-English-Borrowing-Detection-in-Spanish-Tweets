# Detecting English Borrowings in Spanish Tweets

This is a master's capstone project focused on identifying English-origin words in Spanish-language tweets using multilingual transformer models.

## Project Overview

The goal is to classify each token in a tweet as either borrowed from English or not. This involves:
- Preprocessing social media text data
- Fine-tuning multilingual transformer models (mBERT, BETO, RoBERTa)
- Experimenting with LLMs
- Comparing model performance
- Building a demo to visualize token-level predictions

## Current Progress

- [x] Cleaned and tokenized the dataset
- [x] Implemented and evaluated baseline transformer models
- [ ] Fine-tuning models
- [ ] LLM experimentation
- [ ] Demo creation
- [ ] Writing paper


## Notes

This is a work in progress. Code will be updated regularly as the project progresses.
